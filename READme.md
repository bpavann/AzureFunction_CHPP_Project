# 🏡 California Housing Price Prediction
🚀 Serverless ML Web App powered by Azure Functions + XGBoost
This project demonstrates a fully serverless Machine Learning deployment workflow using Azure Functions, Python, and an XGBoost regression model.
Users can input property features through a simple web interface, submit the values, and instantly receive predicted California house prices generated by the cloud-hosted ML model.

## ✨ Features
* ⚡ Serverless ML inference using Azure Function App (HTTP Trigger)
* 🧠 XGBoost Regression Model trained on the California Housing Dataset
* 🌐 Interactive Web Interface for property feature input & prediction display
* ☁️ Fully deployed on Microsoft Azure Cloud
* 📦 Clean, modular ML + cloud architecture
* 🔐 Dependency isolation with requirements.txt

## 🧠 Model Overview
* Algorithm: XGBoost Regressor
* Dataset: California Housing Dataset
* Model Metrics: RMSE, MAE, R²
* Preprocessing Includes:
  * - Missing value handling
  * - Normalization
  * - Feature engineering
* Model Serialization: pickle for cloud integration

## ☁️ Azure Function Deployment
**Architecture Summary**
